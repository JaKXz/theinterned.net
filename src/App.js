          <p>I‚Äôm a seasoned web developer and designer with over 15 years of
            experience working on high profile, heavily-trafficked websites.</p>
          <p>Most recently, I was the lead designer and front-end developer
            on <a href="http://getcarta.com" className="carta">Carta</a>, a
            cloud-based social inventory and order management app. I was
            responsible for the design and development of Carta‚Äôs beautiful and
            responsive interface. Carta is a rich and non-trivial business app
            and I learned a great deal about balancing complexity and ease of
            use.</p>
          <p>I pride myself on writing beautiful, semantic code that is
            cross-browser compatible and standards compliant. I specializes in
            authoring rich user experiences with the latest web technologies.
            I‚Äôm a trained artist and a strong UI and UX designer with an
            interest in user-focused design practices. I‚Äôm creative, fastidious,
            dedicated, ambitious and helpful. I enjoy problem solving,
            collaboration and knowledge-sharing. I‚Äôm a quick study and eager
            contributor.</p>

            under construction</a> like all of the web! I'm looking for work now
